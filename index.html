          The great secret of true success, of true happiness, is this: the man
          or woman who asks for no return, the perfectly unselfish person, is
          the most successful.

          Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life; dream of it; think of
          it; live on that idea. Let the brain, the body, muscles, nerves, every
          part of your body be full of that idea, and just leave every other
          idea alone. This is the way to success, and this is the way great
          spiritual giants are produced.

          You have to grow from the inside out. None can teach you, none can
          make you spiritual. There is no other teacher but your own soul.
